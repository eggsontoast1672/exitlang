# Exitlang

This is probably the stupidest thing that I've ever built by a long shot. I
believe that the description of the repository sums it up pretty succinctly.
Here's some example code:

```python
# This program exits with code 1.
1
```

It's my first try at building any kind of compiler, so we'll see how it goes.
I'd like to have it compile to NASM. The lexer is still being polished up, and
work on the parser will start shortly. I had trouble writing that without
cracking a smile.

If I decide that I care enough about this project, I think it would be kind of
interesting to port it to Zig. That language seems interesting.

Currently, the language does not support anything other than ASCII, and there
are no plans to ever support Unicode or any other character format. It's a toy
language, cry about it.
